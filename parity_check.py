"""Parity test: this repo's sector plotting vs the heatmap board's.

Exists because of the 2026-09-06 Android incident -- "at parity" was declared
after a partial port and the user found the gap in testing. The lesson recorded
then was: diff explicitly against a checklist, never infer. So this is a test,
re-runnable, not a one-off eyeball.

Divergences are not automatically failures. Some are STRUCTURAL and justified.
They must be DECLARED here, so an undeclared one is what fails.
