# F&O rollover screen

Screens the NSE stock-futures universe (210 names) for positioning that agrees
or disagrees with price.

## The three steps

1. **MOM gain** — price momentum
2. **Rollover** — were positions carried into the next series
3. **Cost gain/decline** — did carrying them get more or less expensive

A name that rose, rolled above its norm, *and* at rising cost has longs paying
up to stay. One that rose while rollover collapsed has longs leaving into
strength. The disagreements are the signal; agreement is just trend confirmation.

## The three baselines

Each step is measured against: the **previous month**, the stock's **own
trailing average**, and its **sector average**.

## Data

NSE F&O bhavcopy (`OpnIntrst`, `UndrlygPric`, `ClsPric` per contract per
series). Public, historical, no auth, no broker dependency.

**Rollover formula**, validated to two decimals on 9/9 symbols against an
independently published rollover sheet for 2026-08-25:

    rollover % = (next + far OI) / (near + next + far OI)

`next / (near + next)` is *close* and wrong — it misses by up to 1.0pp
(POWERINDIA 91.35 vs 92.32). It fails quietly, which is worse.

## Why MOM is measured expiry-to-expiry

Deliberate, and checked. Against a published sheet for 2026-08-25, three
candidate windows were compared on six symbols:

| window | closest on |
|---|---|
| expiry -> expiry | **5 of 6** |
| calendar month-end | 1 of 6 |

Neither reproduces the sheet exactly, so the sheet uses something else again
(futures rather than spot, a vendor feed, or hand entry). We are not cloning
it. Expiry-to-expiry is kept because it is both the closer match AND the more
defensible definition: it aligns the price change with exactly the period whose
rollover is being measured.

**Corporate actions ruled out as the cause** (2026-09-26). The two largest
divergences from the sheet, DIXON and SIEMENS, were checked against
`NewBrdLotQty` across 26 bhavcopy files: DIXON's lot is constant at 50 with no
price discontinuity, and SIEMENS' 125 -> 175 lot change in Jan 2026 came with
the price essentially flat (-1.6%), which is NSE's routine lot revision to keep
contract value in band, not a split. A split moves price inversely to lot.
So the screen is not reading split-adjusted prices as real moves.

## Sectors

Reuses `FNO_SECTORS` from
[`nifty-heatmap-core`](https://github.com/abhijeetbishayee-drb/nifty-heatmap-core),
**fetched at runtime, never vendored** — a second copy would drift. Sectors with
fewer than 5 F&O members get no sector baseline: an average over one member is
that member, and the resulting 0.00 deviation looks like data.
