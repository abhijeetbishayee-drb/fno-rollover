"""Sector taxonomy for the rollover screen.

REUSES the curated 23-sector taxonomy from `nifty-heatmap-core` (FNO_SECTORS)
rather than inventing a second one that would drift from it.

It is FETCHED at runtime, not vendored. A vendored snapshot is a second copy,
and this project's own history is a catalogue of two-copies-drifting bugs --
including the one that created nifty-heatmap-core in the first place. The cache
is a fallback for no-network, never the primary.

Two adaptations, both deliberate:
  * tickers normalised (board uses Yahoo `ABB.NS`, bhavcopy uses `ABB`)
  * CASH_ONLY names dropped -- no futures, so no rollover

MIN_PEERS exists because a "sector average" over one member IS that member:
the deviation is exactly 0.00, which LOOKS like data. Groups under the floor
get NO sector baseline and are reported as such, never silently averaged.
